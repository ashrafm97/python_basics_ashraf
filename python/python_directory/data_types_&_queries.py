# single quotes can cause problems when you want to use an apostrophe..



# string_fixed = 'I said \'Wow!\''

# print(string_fixed)

# quote_in_quote =

# HW = "hello! world"
# print(HW[5:])

# this is slicing

# this is stripping

# white_space = "lots of space at the end          "
# print(len(white_space))

# print(len(white_space.strip()))


# some more methods to try now...

example_text = "SOME text here"
# print(example_text.count("text"))

# this is count which counts how many times the "  " appears in the example_text value

# print(example_text.lower())

# prints as lower or upper case when asked..

# print(example_text.capitalize())

# This makes the first letter uppercase and doesnt touch the rest of the string

# print(example_text.replace("SOME", "plenty"))

# replacing text

# concatenation is mixing strings and casting is ?replacing one data type with another?
# x = 2
# y = 5.4
# z = "string"
# print( z + " " + str(x) + " " + str(y))

# x = "2"
# print(str(x), int(x), str(x), float(x)



# booleans now
# they are true or false only...
# a = True
# b = False
# c = 2
# d = 1
# print(c==d)
# print(c>d)

# <,>, !=, ==
greetings = "Hello! World"

print(greetings.startswith("h"))
print(greetings.endswith("d"))

# self explanatory

print((bool(0)))
print("" == None)

## "  " isnt None
